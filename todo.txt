1. Visualize the image arithmetic on example images, including hamiltonian product
2. Polar coordinates, add to discription and add images
3. Redo activation functions on images
4. Adapt those images from the complex case to the quaternion one
5. Redo that image of the perceptron
6. Add table on the applications, networks: LSTM | Transformer | Hybrid - Table????
7. Make training of identical real/quaternion networks and use tsne to visualize features
8. Make training of quaternion networks with Make illustration for random initialization: just training
5. Make comparsion decision boundary: real/non-linear/quaternion/spin
0. Make a graph to visualize batch normalization
