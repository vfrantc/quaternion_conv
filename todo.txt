1. Figure out how to make that graph of
2. Make training of identical real/quaternion networks and use tsne to visualize features
3. Make illustration for normalization: stats and training results
4. Make illustration for random initialization: just training
5. Make comparsion decision boundary: real/non-linear/quaternion/spin
